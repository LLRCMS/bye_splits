Implementation of the CMS HGCAL Trigger Backend Stage 2 in Python, mimicking the CMSSW implementation.

It can be used for quick prototyping, debugging and optimization.
It can also generate event visualization apps, since it includes a (very) simplified version of the HGCA geometry.
It was originally used for understanding and fixing the observed cluster splitting.

Various presentations based on the framework are available `here <https://github.com/LLRCMS/bye_splits/wiki/Resources>`_.

.. warning::
   The project is in a work-in-progress status.
   This means that no guarantees are provided for anything to work out-of-the-box (though most of it should, with little to no change ðŸ™‚).

   If you spot clearly outdated code, or if something does not run, please :ref:`contact` me.
   Of course, proposing a code change directly via a `PR <https://github.com/LLRCMS/bye_splits/pulls/>`_ is much welcomed and preferred.
